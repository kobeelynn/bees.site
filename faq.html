            Why?

        <p>
            This website is being created to help share my love of books. I know how hard it can be to find a new book, and all the most popular book reviewers always seem to have a secondary agenda or are simply much older that many of the target audiences. This is a site where you can find and read reviews on books as well as comment your own reviews. As everyone has different taste and preferences you can get a wide range of opinions.

                The Ideal and purpose of this site is to excite and encourage people to read, and not just read but share with others what they read and liked about certain books. The goal is also to help people find new books to read. With the site being updated weekly (or biweekly) there are always new books to explore. It won’t just be the same 10 books being recommended to you every time, but they will have variety. From fantasy to murder mysteries, rom coms to biography’s we have it all. And if we don’t have it yet you can bet it’s coming.
