            This is an older book and I actually had one of my teachers ask me why I was reading ‘the top travel book of the early 2000’s’ no joke those where the exact words he used. 

I really enjoyed this novel it was really interesting to read and I learned so much about the catholic religion and some early philosophers and artist which was extremely cool. 

I thought the twist and turns this story led you down were really well done, I felt the stress that the characters had to be going through and I finished the last half of the book this morning because I could not put it down. 

The only thing I didn’t like about this book was the final little twist that Brown tried to squeeze in there, I though it would’ve been a better finish to leave that part out entirely. But besides that I though this was a great book and I would definitely recommend. 

If you are looking to buy this book I would recommend going to a used bookstore/ thrift bookstore because I got this illustrated edition (pictures of all the artifacts and important places) for only 6$ and they had a bunch of copies of all the Dan Brown books. 

I’m definitely looking forward to reading more of Browns novels in the future!
