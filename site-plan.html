        [Why?
        This website is being created to help share my love of books. I know how hard it can be to find a new book, and all the most popular book reviewers always seem to have a secondary agenda or are simply much older that many of the target audiences. This is a site where you can find and read reviews on books as well as comment your own reviews. As everyone has different taste and preferences you can get a wide range of opinions.
      
      Questions Answered?
        The Ideal and purpose of this site is to excite and encourage people to read, and not just read but share with others what they read and liked about certain books. The goal is also to help people find new books to read. With the site being updated weekly (or biweekly) there are always new books to explore. It won’t just be the same 10 books being recommended to you every time, but they will have variety. From fantasy to murder mysteries, rom coms to biography’s we have it all. And if we don’t have it yet you can bet it’s coming. 
      
      Activities available on the site?
        Visitors will be able to tour a large variety of book as well as read and contribute to the descriptions and rating. Although there will be a standard rating of what the creators of the website thoughts were visitors will have the opportunity to comment and have conversations with others in a comment section under the book and description labels. This allows interaction with not only the creator of the website but other users of this website. Creating not just a platform for shared information but a community of people sharing their thoughts, love, and even dislike of the novels. 
        There will also be a featured novel of the week that will appear on the front page and will change weekly to different literature. 
      
      Information Necessary?
        You don’t need to know much to use this site just a desire to pick up a book. And even if you don’t have the desire, we hope we can help you with that too. But if someone does wish to comment It would be appreciated if they did in fact read the book beforehand so that they may have a true insight on the literature they are reading before potentially spreading false information. All are welcome to their opinion and we know that there may be disagreements about certain things regarding books but it is asked that you do gain a knowledge of the books and other forms of literature prior to making statements about what you liked or didn’t like. 
      
      Why this site?
        Well the goal is to grow this website into a bigger than itself site, where it’s more of a community blog where you can see what your friends recently read and likes and didn’t like.  Where you can meet new friends and strangers and talk about books you are passionate about. (Think Facebook but with less face and more book.) This community setting would set it apart from any other book site as it hopefully makes a name for itself and spread and grows and develops along the way. Although it will be a process to make this as great as we envision it can be and bring to life all our ideas and desires we hope to be a bright light in the world of books.
      
      Additional Info:
      Reading seems to be a dying hobby. A survey was done in 2018 by the Washington post bout the number of Americans that read simply for pleasure. And the resulting numbers were shocking. Only about 19% of Americans over the age of 15 read for pleasure, this websites main purpose is created in the hopes of raising that number helping people come to love reading and the escape it offers you. As well as the people and community you can find when sharing a book you love with someone else.
